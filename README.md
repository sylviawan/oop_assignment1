Assignment 1 for Object Oriented Programming

This is a small game explaining planets. 

You are first welcomed by a home screen. In this screen you can change constellations by clicking onto the “New Constellation” button.

When you press ‘z’, the game begins. You press the arrows to navigate around the box. When you hover above a planet, descriptions appears and you can also destroy the planets because — why not? 

You can also return to the home screen by pressing ‘z’ again.

I have attempted to include sounds but it didn't work out.

** I forgot to add in the video, on the game screen you can change the positions of the planets by clicking the spinning pink button.
